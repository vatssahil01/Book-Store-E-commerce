# Book Store E-commerce Application

Welcome to the **Book Store E-commerce** project! This is a full-stack web application designed to provide a seamless platform for users to browse, purchase, and manage books. It features a robust backend API and a modern, responsive frontend interface.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive E-commerce solution specifically tailored for selling books. It serves as a practical demonstration of a modern MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application.

The primary goal is to create a secure and user-friendly environment where:
*   **Users** can sign up, verify their emails via OTP, login, browse books, add them to a cart, and manage their profiles.
*   **Admins** can manage users and potentially books (depending on role configuration).
*   **Authors** can potentially contribute content.

This application is built with scalability and security in mind, utilizing industry-standard practices like JWT authentication, password hashing, and secure API structure.

## ✨ Features

### 👤 User Features
*   **Secure Authentication**:
    *   Sign Up with Email Verification (OTP sent via Email).
    *   Secure Login with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
    *   Forgot Password / Resend OTP functionality.
    *   Logout.
*   **Book Browsing**: View a list of available books and detailed book information.
*   **Shopping Cart**: Add books to a shopping cart for purchase.
*   **User Profile**: View and manage personal profile details.

### 🛡️ Admin & Technical Features
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Distinct roles for Users, Authors, and Admins.
*   **User Management**: Admins can view/delete users and update user details.
*   **Security Mechanisms**:
    *   Password Encryption using `bcrypt`.
    *   Rate limiting and security headers (implemented/planned).
    *   Protected Routes ensuring only authorized access to specific endpoints.
*   **Image Uploads**: dedicated middleware for handling profile picture uploads.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project utilizes the **MERN** stack, chosen for its efficiency in building full-stack JavaScript applications.

### **Frontend (Client-Side)**
*   **React.js**: A powerful library for building dynamic user interfaces.
*   **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling for fast builds and development.
*   **React Router DOM**: Handles navigation and routing within the single-page application.
*   **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
*   **React Hot Toast**: For beautiful, non-intrusive notifications (flash messages).
*   **React Icons**: Provides a suite of standard icons.
*   **Vanilla CSS**: Custom styling for full design control.

### **Backend (Server-Side)**
*   **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
*   **Express.js**: Fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
*   **MongoDB & Mongoose**: NoSQL database and Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for strict data modeling.
*   **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure, stateless authentication.
*   **Bcrypt**: For hashing and salting passwords.
*   **Nodemailer**: Module for sending emails (used for OTPs).
*   **Multer**: Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data` (file uploads).

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The project is divided into two main directories: `Frontend` and `Backend`.

```plaintext

## 🔄 Data Flow Explanation

1.  **User Interaction**: A user interacts with the Frontend (e.g., clicks "Sign Up").
2.  **API Request**: The Frontend (using Axios) sends an HTTP Request (POST) to the Backend API endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/users/signup`).
3.  **Routing & Middleware**:
    *   The request hits `app.js` and is routed to `userRoute.js`.
    *   Middleware checks if data is valid or if the user is authorized (if needed).
4.  **Controller Logic**: The logic in `authController.js` executes.
    *   It may check the database (MongoDB) via the `User` Model.
    *   Example: Checks if the email already exists.
5.  **Database Operation**: Mongoose handles queries to the MongoDB database.
6.  **Response**:
    *   Success: The controller sends back a JSON response (e.g., status 200, JWT token, user data).
    *   Error: The global error handler sends a standardized error message.
7.  **UI Update**: The Frontend receives the response and updates the state (e.g., redirects to OTP page or shows an error toast).

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization Flow

The security of this application relies on **JWT** and **Email Verification**.

1.  **Sign Up**: User enters details -> Backend generates a random OTP (utilizing `crypto` for security) -> Saves hashed password and OTP to DB -> Sends OTP via Email.
2.  **Verify OTP**: User enters OTP -> Backend verifies it against the DB -> Marks user as verified -> Logins user (issues JWT).
3.  **Login**: User enters credentials -> Backend verifies password (bcrypt) -> Issues **JWT Token**.
4.  **Protected Requests**:
    *   The Frontend includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header (`Bearer <token>`).
    *   **Protect Middleware**: Verifies the token. If valid, attaches the user to the request object (`req.user`).
    *   **RestrictTo Middleware**: Checks if `req.user.role` has permission (e.g., 'admin').

## ▶️ Running the Project

You need to run the Frontend and Backend servers simultaneously (in two separate terminal windows).

### Start Backend
```bash
cd Backend
npm start
# Server should run on http://localhost:5000
```

### Start Frontend
```bash
cd Frontend
npm run dev
# Vite server usually runs on http://localhost:5173
```

Now, open your browser and visit the Frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
